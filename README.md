# InfoCenter 🖥️

A minimal macOS menu bar app built with Python and [rumps](https://github.com/jaredks/rumps) that displays system information such as CPU usage, memory, storage, battery, clipboard, IP addresses, and more — directly in the menu bar.

## Features

- ⚡ CPU, memory, storage, and battery, uptime stats
- 📋 Clipboard history
